# dirty-dish-neural-network

A machine learning project that classifies images of dishes as either dirty or clean using a convolutional neural 
network coupled with SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). This project demonstrates the use of deep learning and 
feature extraction techniques for binary classification.

## Environment Setup
Make sure you have python 3.10 installed on your machine
To setup the environment first create a virtual environment: `python3.10 -m venv .venv`
Then activate the environment: `source .venv/vin/activate`
Then run the kernel setup script:  `./create_venv_kernel.sh`
Now select .venv as your Jupyter kernel and run the cells
