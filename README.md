# dirty-dish-neural-network

A machine learning project that classifies images of dishes as either dirty or clean using a convolutional neural network coupled with SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform). This project demonstrates the use of deep learning and feature extraction techniques for binary classification.
